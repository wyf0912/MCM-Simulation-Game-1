\begin{abstract}%摘要


\indent  In recent years, with he rapid development in economy and explosive growth in population, environment pollution and depletion of resources have been aggravated day by day. Smart Growth was then put forward. Lots of cities have drawn up the development plans on basis of the combination of ten principles for Smart Growth and their own conditions. Our work is to evaluate the success of each city in Smart Growth and provide a guidance for plan making.Meanwhile, we need to measure the success of our smart growth plan. Therefore, we define the "Smart Growth Index" (SGI) to measure the success of smart growth and development plans of a city. \\
\indent  Our model establishes a Detail group of 52 indictors, which reflects the ten principles for smart growth and the three E's of sustainability. On basis of this, we can assess the success of smart growth of a city. In the construction of SGI model, we use linear aggregation to combine individual variables into the theme scores. Compensability of linear aggregation ensures fair assessment of different cities which have different emphasis in urban development. Then we use geometric aggregation to combine theme scores into SGI. Low compensability of geometric aggregation requires a city to develop evenly in all themes. We use entropy method to determine weights of indictors or themes, which avoid subjectivity. SGI model has an all-round and objective assessment of the success of smart growth of a city.\\
\indent  With the completion of these, we respectively select a city in China and America (Zhenjiang and Columbia.SC). We assess the success of city development and their smart growth on basis of SGI model. 
Finally, we proved the reasonability and applicability of our model.\\

\indent We want to establish such a viable model which can automatically add hot water to keep the temperature of the bathtub at the comfort temperature. At the same time saving water resources needs to be considered.\\\indent To solve this problem, we need to consider the impact of the bathtub shape and size on this model.

%Section 3
\section{Heat Dissipation Model}
In order to analyze the situation of heat dissipation. 
We need to start from the bathtub.
The effect of a bathtub on heat loss is mainly in material and shape.\\
\indent The surface area of the liquid is variable because of the different shapes and attributes about bathtubs. Likewise the contact area of liquid and bathtub. Therefore We use functions to describe the relationship between the surface area of liquid, the liquid surface height and the contact area of liquid and bathtub. \\
\indent We use these abstract expression to avoid the effect of exact shapes and attributes on the model.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
h=H(h)  \\
S_{1}=S_{1}(v) \\
S_{2}=S_{2}(v)  \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\indent The water in the bathtub dissipates heat by contacting the air on the upper surface and the bathtub wall on the side surface. So we So we decompose the model into two parts:\\
\indent \indent1) Liquid surface heat loss model\\
\indent \indent2) contact area of liquid and bathtub heat loss model
\subsection{Liquid surface heat loss model}
\indent In unit time, the heat dissipation of the water surface is \cite{1}
\begin{equation}
 dQ=dQ_{a}+dQ_{b}+dQ_{c}=[\alpha (t-\theta)+\beta ({p}''_{v}-p_{v})+\varepsilon \sigma (t+273)^{4})]dS 
\end{equation}
\indent \indent \indent $\varepsilon$ is the emissivity. The value is 0.97\\
\indent \indent \indent $\sigma$ is a constant. The value is $5.6\times 10^{-8}$\\
\indent \indent \indent In the actual process, $\beta$ and $\alpha$ can be obtained by General formula \cite{2}:\\
\begin{equation}
 \beta=\sqrt{[22.0+12.5W^{2}+2.0(t-\theta)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\alpha}{\beta}=b=\frac{P_{a}C_{p}}{0.623L}
\end{equation}
\indent $C_{p}$ is the specific heat capacity of dry air. As the temperature changes, there is little change in the value. So we take the value as the temperature equals to 300k.\\
\begin{equation}
C_{p}=1.005KJ/(kg\cdot K)
\end{equation}
\indent According to assumption (3), the temperature of the water has the same value. So during unit time, the total heat dissipating capacity in the upper surface is:\\
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Q_{upper}&=\int_{upper} dQ\\
&= \int_{upper}\alpha (t-\theta)+\beta ({p}''_{v}-p_{v})+\varepsilon \sigma (t+273)^{4}dS	\\
&=[\alpha (t-\theta)+\beta ({p}''_{v}-p_{v})+\varepsilon \sigma (t+273)^{4}]\cdot S_{1}\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{side area of bathtub heat loss model} 	%4.2
\indent The heat dissipated area is the contact part between bathtub and liquid.So we just need to think about the effect of contact area. \\ \indent For the water in the side surface of the bathtub is not in direct contact with the air, there will be no evaporation. Therefore there will not be $ dQ_{b} $ in the equation (4.2). Considering of the reflex of thermal radiation between water and the side surface, $dQ_{c}$ will change.\\ \indent The material of the side surface of the bathtub is acrylic. The index of refraction of acrylic is $n_{1}\approx 1.4$, the index of refraction of water is $ n_{0}\approx 1.33 $.\\ \indent So the reflection coefficient is 
\begin{equation}
	 R=\frac{(n_{0}-n_{1})^{2}}{(n_{0}+n_{1})^{2}}=\frac{(1.4-1.33)^{2}}{(1.4+1.33)^2}=0.06 
\end{equation}
\indent Then in the equation(4.2),  the $dQ_{c}$ will be multiplied by ($1-R=0.94$).  Therefore, the heat dissipating capacity during unit time in the side surface is :
\begin{equation}
	dQ=dQ_{a}+0.94dQ_{c}=[\alpha (t-\theta)+0.94\varepsilon \sigma (t+273)^{4}]dS
\end{equation}
\indent According to assumption (3), the temperature of the water has the same value. So during unit time, the total heat dissipating capacity in the side surface is :				%4.9
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Q_{side}&=\int_{side}dQ\\
&= \int_{side} [\alpha (t-\theta)+0.94\varepsilon \sigma (t+273)^{4}]dS	\\
&=[\alpha (t-\theta)+0.94\varepsilon \sigma (t+273)^{4}]S_{3}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\subsection{the bathtub heat loss model} 	%4.2

\indent Just as I mentioned above, the water in the bathtub dissipates heat by contacting the air on the upper surface and the bathtub wall on the side surface. \\

\indent So the total heat dissipating capacity during unit time is:
\begin{equation}
	Q_{0}=Q_{upper}+Q_{side}
\end{equation}


\indent The specific forms of $Q_{upper}$ and $Q_{side}$ can be obtained from the above. 

\section{Model of hot water addition}
\indent First, we should establish an abstract model to describe the heating process.\\
\indent The bathtub is heated by the tap infusion. So we should consider the energy and the volume of water in unit time. \\\indent Set the unit time flow of the faucet as $ V $, and the temperature of the water poured in is $ t_{in} {^\circ}C$. At the same time, the specific heat capacity of water of water changes in a very small degree with the fluctuations in temperature.So we approximate the value as the temperature is 300k. \\
\indent Compared to the energy reference, during unit time the energy of water poured in is:
\begin{equation}
	q_{in}=C_{water}\rho V(t_{in}-36) 
\end{equation}
\indent Adding hot water is a continuous process. Then in the constant $ T_{1} $ seconds of adding hot water, the total energy brought into the bathtub is:
\begin{equation}
	Q_{in}=q_{in}T_{1}=C_{water}\rho V(t_{in}-36)T_{1}
\end{equation}
\indent Meanwhile, the volume of water brought into the bathtub is:
\begin{equation}
	\bigtriangleup_{volume}=VT_{1} 
\end{equation}
\subsection{Changes in the volume of water in a bathtub}

\subsubsection{People take the initiative to drain through the drain of the bathtub}

\subsubsection{Water overflow through the upper drain}
\section{Solutions for tasks}
\subsection{Model Implementation with Computer}
\indent In the above, We've got a general model of heating and heat loss. Take advantage of the two general models we have already obtained, we established a simulation program built with python. It can simulate the process of heating and heat loss. We can use the simulation program to solve the water temperature model of bathtub.\\
\indent The initial temperature of water is set at $38.0^{\circ}C$, the room temperature is set at $18.0^{\circ}$. And the amount of inflowing water is regarded as variable. We can change the value of it to control the amount of inflowing water.
\subsection{model testing}			%6.2 model test
\indent First, we need to verify the accuracy of the heat dissipation model.
We want to verify whether the model of the temperature change over time is in accordance with the actual situation.\\
\indent We set the bath time as half an hour. And we don't add hot water or bubble bath additive in the bathtub. \\
\indent picture!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\
\indent The model implementation with computer is shown in the figure.
We can get that the temperature in the bathtub has fallen as time goes on.It drops 4.5$^{\circ}C$ as half an hour in the bathtub. And in the indoor environment, we find the temperature of most bathtub without constant temperature system drops from 3 to 5$^{\circ}C$ in half an hour. Our

\section{Factors that affect the model}
\subsection{Different shapes of the bathtub}
We model and analysis several different shapes of bathtubs.
\subsubsection{Bathtub based on ovals}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=8cm]{oval.png}}
\caption{The shape of bathtub based on ovals}
\label{oval}	
\end{figure}
The elliptical long axis on the bottom of the bathtub is $A$, the short axis is $B$, the height of the whole bathtub is $h$, and the lower bottom long axis is $A-2d$.\\
\indent We divide the bathtub into an infinite number of elliptical columns with a height of $dz$, with a long semi-axis of each elliptical element\\
\begin{equation}
a(z)=\frac{A}{2}-d+\frac{d}{{H}^{2}}{z}^{2}
\end{equation}
\indent Short semi-axis of each elliptical element is
\begin{equation}
b(z)=\frac{B}{2}-d\frac{B}{A}+\frac{Bd}{A{H}^{2}}{z}^{2}
\end{equation}\\
\textbf{Calculation of the volume of water} \\\\
\indent The volume of the small cylinder is
\begin{equation}
dV=Sdz=\pi a(z)b(z)
\end{equation}
\indent The relationship between the volume of water in the bathtub and the height of the liquid surface is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
V(h)&=\int dV=\int Sdz=\int_{0}^{h}\pi a(z)b(z)dz \\
&=\int_{0}^{h}\pi(\frac{A}{2}-d+\frac{d{z}^{2}}{{H}^{2}})(\frac{B}{2}-d\frac{B}{A}+\frac{dB{z}^{2}}{A{H}^{2}})dz
\label{V}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\indent We can get relationship between the volume of water and the height of liquid surface by replacing the bathtub size into the formula (\ref{V}).\\\\
\textbf{Calculation of the contact area of water with the bathtub and air} \\\\
\indent Without considering the effect of person, the upper and lower surface of the liquid contact are standard ovals.\\
\indent The area of upper surface is\\
\begin{equation}
S_{1}=\frac{\pi AB}{4}
\end{equation}
\indent And area of the lower surface is\\
\begin{equation}
	S_{2}=\frac{\pi (A-2d)(B-2d\frac{B}{A})}{4}
\end{equation}
\indent In order to calculate the contact area between the liquid and side of the bathtub, we use the calculus method.

\subsection{The effect of human body and body temperature on the model}
%subsection 4.1
We improved our model in view of the human body influence. Our improvement is mainly in the following aspects.
\subsubsection{The influence of the heat conduction}%sub subsection 4.1.1
The interior of the body is basically maintained at a constant temperature, and the temperature of the skin is close to the water in bathtub. So we can simplify the question.The simplified question is illustrated as floows.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=6cm]{skin.png}}
\caption{Heat conduction model of human body}
\label{skin}
\end{figure}
\indent We can assume that the temperature of the skin is the same as the water. We select the temperature of the rectum about 37.5 degrees as the body temperature. The problem can be simplified as the skin heat dissipating to the interior of the body.\\
\indent So we can use {\bf Newton's law of cooling} to calculate the speed of heat dissipation.\\
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta T&=|T_{w}-T_{f}| \\
q&=h\Delta T	\\
\phi &=qA=Ah\Delta T
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\indent Where \textbf{\emph{q}} is the heat flux density. \textbf{\emph{h}} is the convection heat transfer coefficient of matter. \textbf{\emph{$\phi$}}  is heat transfer power (or heat transfer per unit time). \textbf{\emph{A}} is the heat transfer area.\\
\indent The surface area of the human body can be calculated by the following formula.
\begin{equation}
S= \begin{cases} & 0.0057*h+0.0121*w+0.0820\text{( man )} \\ & 0.0073*h+0.0127*w-0.2106\text{(woman)} \end{cases}
\label{s}
\end{equation}
\indent According to formula \ref{skin}, the quantity of heat dissipated($dQ$) in unit time is:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d} Q}{\mathrm{d} t}=\phi =qA=Sh\Delta T
	\label{Q_skin}
\end{equation}
where \emph{h}=1.48,${T_{f}}=37.5^{\circ}$. \\
\subsubsection{The influence of the body shape}
The volume of the person in the water affects the height of the liquid. In order to discuss the influence on the liquid surface conveniently. We use the weight to estimate the volume of the body. We use $\rho =1.06\times10^{3}kg/m^{3}$ as the density of the human body, so the volume can be calculated:
\begin{equation}
v=\frac{m}{\rho }=\frac{m}{1.06\times 10^{3}}(m^{3})
\end{equation}
